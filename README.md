# Full Stack Project

## Overview

This is a full-stack project consisting of a **frontend** and a **backend**.

### Frontend
The frontend is built using modern tools and frameworks, and it is responsible for the client-side user interface.

### Backend
The backend is a Node.js application, handling server-side logic, APIs, and database operations.

## Project Structure

### Frontend
Key files and directories in the frontend:
- `src/`: Contains the main application source code.
- `public/`: Public static files.
- `index.html`: Entry point for the application.
- `package.json`: Lists frontend dependencies.
- `vite.config.js`: Configuration for Vite, the development server.
- `tailwind.config.js`: Configuration for Tailwind CSS.

### Backend
Key files and directories in the backend:
- `index.js`: Main entry point of the backend application.
- `controllers/`: Contains controller logic for routes.
- `models/`: Database models for the application.
- `routes/`: Contains API route definitions.
- `.env`: Configuration file for environment variables.
- `package.json`: Lists backend dependencies.
